Google Play,"Meh. Not the greatest experience on a Chromebook. Seems to be customized for phones only. Opens in a little screen that you can't expand or resize - for reasons that are a complete mystery to me. Judging from the fact that every other app I know of is resizeable, this seems like it was a conscious choice by the developers . Why you'd do something like this is beyond understanding and suggests a control freak approach. Not a great way to make a first impression.",2,2023-07-08 14:18:24,"['ya', 'ampun', 'alam', 'hebat', 'chromebook', 'sesuai', 'ponsel', 'buka', 'layar', 'luas', 'ubah', 'ukur', 'alas', 'misteri', 'nilai', 'fakta', 'aplikasi', 'ubah', 'ukur', 'pilih', 'sadar', 'kembang', 'paham', 'dekat', 'gila', 'kendali', 'bagus', 'kesan']",1,negative
Google Play,Pretty good for a first launch!! Its easy to use and self-explanatory and I'd say the algorithm is good as well. It has great *potential* but a few things need improvement: -the ability to use hashtags would make it easier to find topics and people you'd be interested in -an option for a following-only feed would be a major improvement (especially chronological order) -the ability to choose images from albums rather than recent photos -the ability to save photos to phone,3,2023-07-19 20:52:48,"['bagus', 'luncur', 'mudah', 'algoritme', 'bagus', 'milik', 'potensi', 'tingkat', 'mampu', 'hashtag', 'mudah', 'temu', 'topik', 'orang', 'minat', 'pilih', 'feed', 'tingkat', 'urut', 'kronologis', 'mampu', 'pilih', 'gambar', 'album', 'foto', 'baru', 'mampu', 'simpan', 'foto', 'telepon']",2,neutral
Google Play,"For a brand new app, it's very well optimized. However it's just missing quite a few features that apps like Twitter have. There is no way to have your timeline show threads from who you're following. It would also be nice to be able to switch accounts quickly like on Insta. I've also noticed that videos have a hard time playing audio sometimes. Overall, it's a decent first version that I hope will get more features as time goes on.

Google Play,"Great app with a lot of potential! However, there is a lot that needs to be fixed. For example, the option to mute accounts is lagging/delayed. This feature is definitely needed at this stage, which is part of the next problem. Another issue I've noticed is the home page shows a lot of accounts I don't follow and have never heard of, and a lot of blue check accounts that I don't want to see.

Google Play,"The app is good, but it needs a lot of functionality. For example, when searching a topic, you don't find anything related to that topic, meaning anything that comes to you is via your main page, which incase lowers a lot of outreach and possibility of finding content that relates to you.
